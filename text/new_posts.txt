Greatest Comment Thread Ever I feel like an archaeologist who just across a manuscript of Jesus debating Aristotle, or Einstein going at it with Clauswitz, or Allah talking trash with Goldstein, or Babe Ruth chatting with Joan of Arc.

Rob sez: "Rod McLaren has a fantastic series of blog entries running (indexed in the link above) called 'How we work'. It has insights into the work methods used by the worlds most creative/productive/innovative people.

"So far the range includes Chatwin, Autechre, Giotto and Calatrava to name just a few."

++ Update on Louis Rossetto's mother's house
http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/08/update_on_louis_ross.html
Mark Frauenfelder:
A couple of days ago, I wrote about the problems Louis Rossetto's mother was having trying to get permission from the city to add a small addition to her house in Berkeley (Link). On Monday, Berkeley's  Landmarks Preservation Commission held a meeting to decide whether to grant landmark status to the house. In short, his mother got permission to build the addition. Congratulations!

Here's Louis' report from the meeting:

A report from the front: the battle was lost - but the war won!

Last night was my mother's Landmarks Preservation Commission hearing. Her 900 square foot two bedroom addition took three hours of discussion. In the end, the LPC voted 5 to 4 to designate her house a landmark. They then turned around and voted 9 to 0 to accept one of the two designs for the addition that my mother had submitted - proving that my mother wasn't threatening her "historic" Wurster in the first place.

I am both exhilarated and depressed by the experienced. Exhilarated because we beat those motherfucking neighbors and my mother can build her bedroom. And saddened to have witnessed first hand a truly arbitrary, philistine process that must be repeated ad nauseum across America, and that causes neighborhood wars, promotes mediocrity (if not worse), and can leave people emotionally and financially ruined without even protecting the alleged purposes of the landmark ordinances.

As my mother wrote in her ad, this wasn't about preservation, this was about the local Soviet trying to assert its control over the block. After the vote to designate, one of the neighbors behind the landmark petition came over to my mother and magnanimously "welcomed" her to the neighborhood. The problem with that is my mother has been living in her house for four years already, and that their "welcome" amounted to the taking of her property. When they then lost the war when the Commission - shamed by the role they had just played in the obvious injustice visited on my mother - voted 9 to 0 to accept her design, I wanted to go over to this now ashen-faced neighbor and "welcome" him to reality.

People write above about the "benefits" of this kind of kangaroo court to civic and even property values, but from my mother's experience, these kinds of processes protect neither. It was unclear whether a majority of the commission had even visited my mother's house - only one took up her invitation to see it. The Berkeley standard for designation is that the property is the "first, last, or only" example of its kind, but the Commission had done no research into the number of Wurster houses that had been built, whether this one was better or worse than any of the others, or even whether Wurster was really anything more than a local hero. Commissioners pontificated at length on the house and Wurster, but they literally did not know what they were talking about. In fact, if you do a google on Wurster, you get about 700 links (a lot of them having to do with my mother's case). Do one on another local Berkeley architect, Bernard Maybeck, and you get an order of magnitude more - 8K. Do one on another local, Julia Morgan, and you get 30K. That should tell you something about Wurster's relative stature.

The very scariest thing about the proceedings last night was that there were at least two members of the LPC who believed that their job was not just to consider buildings that had been brought to them for landmarking, but they should actively be increasing the number of buildings in the City's "inventory." As one of them put it, "There are 40,000 buildings in Berekley, and we have landmarked only 300." This, in a city that's barely 100 years old, and which already has more landmarked buildings, as I have noted, than San Francisco which is half a century older and has seven times the population.

And their criteria for landmarking? Berkeley has landmarked parking lots, has landmarked empty lots, has landmarked rocks, has landmarked factories where "whites and blacks worked together for the first time." Listening to these commissioners, you can easily imagine them finding something in every building in the city that would justify landmarking, and if not in the building itself, perhaps in its relationship to its neighborhood, to the trees on the site, to the "streetscape," to the feeling of the street, . . .

Anyway, my mother can build her bedroom. And I intend to make a contribution to the Institute for Justice. Once again, we are shown that tyranny isn't just a national threat; it starts, and is perhaps most pernicious, on your own block.

++ Animated iPod enthusiasm
http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/37640
How many consumer products are so loved that users create elaborate animations to showcase their enthusiasm? Only one that I can think of. (He has apparently had problems with having enough bandwidth to host the video, so you'll need to follow the "On to the iPod mini ad" link on his page to get to the mirror du jour.)


I'm behind the iPod curve here, because despite being a gadget guy, a music guy, and a (kind-of) internet and computer guy, I didn't get one until a few months ago.  I must say it has changed my outlook on life, especially when driving, because instead of constantly cursing while switching radio stations every 10 seconds, I now carry my own radio station with me, and it never plays any songs I hate. (my first post, please be gentle!)

++ Floggies!
http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/37636
With the next round of bloggies (or web log awards for those not down with the hip lingo), there's some concern that some types of blogs with large communities may not be included.  Specifically, communities that are well known for tons of online events, and large gathering places whose interactions leak in to and out from real life.  So, the food bloggers (floggers?) have done what they do best, and started their own awards - with 14 nomination categories, the results plan to, at the very least, make us all drool, if not inspire a few feasts here and there.

Sez here that Starbucks is an emerging threat to music retailers. Starbucks was a key partner in financing the Grammy-nominated "Genius Loves Company" Ray Charles album, and outsold more than most traditional music retailers.

The article kind of confirms what I've hearing a lot of this year: it's becoming harder to sell records at record stores. Starbucks figured out that their ideal clientele probably also fits the profile of a particular type of music buyer, and they're taking advantage of that. It's probably the same type of customer that Jack Black's character in High Fidelity would have loved to slander, but at the end of the day, who cares where you buy your music?
